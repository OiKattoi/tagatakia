          Ta Gatakia is an interim project to the series, to be considered a “special
          event” launch on the Ethereum blockchain, with an A.I. generated series of

          “Ta Kattouthkia” (v3) is a series successor, the sequel to “Oi Kattes”
          (v2), which in turn is a sequel to “Oi Kattoi” (v1). Ta Kattouthkia is to
          be considered version 3 of the series and the final version, which will
          close the project with another Solana blockchain-based NFT that will be
          supported by a 2d video game (playable on iOS and Android) with benefits to
          the NFT holders of v1 and v2.
